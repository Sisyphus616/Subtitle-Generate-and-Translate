1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
 You'd already be where you belong.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:06,000
 You're wrong.

3
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:33,000
 Lower.

4
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:37,000
 Lower.

5
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
 No, no, no. Not you.

6
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,000
 Do you want to know why you've never been chosen?

7
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
 Yes. It's your smell.

8
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:05,000
 The firstborn are attracted to power and potential and you.

9
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:12,000
 Desperation with notes of mediocrity.

10
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,000
 You're never going to be one of us.

11
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:18,000
 All right.

12
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:24,000
 We need to send a message to everyone who's ever stood against us.

13
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,000
 Starting with these sanctimonious whores.
